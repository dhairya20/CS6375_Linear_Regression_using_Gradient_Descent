Readme

In order to run the code, you need to have two files with you. 

1. part1.py
2. part2.py

After getting both files, you can make use of command prompt or windows terminal and follow the below steps.

Step-1: Firstly, you need to make sure whether python is installed on your machine or not. 
You can do it with the following command: python --version 
If you are not getting the python version, you need to download it from the following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Step-2: After that, you need to install different libraries with the following command, if you have already installed the libraries, ignore this step.
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib sklearn

Step-3: To run the python files, you need to be in the folder where the part1.py and part2.py is and use the following commands
For part1: python part1.py
For part2: python part2.py

If this doesnâ€™t work, you can run both the files in google colab:
Part1: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14hZ9eSrIjWixcx6NJjWcpN3jJSoeuvZb?usp=sharing
Part2: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MRM7yOCNq4rYocHh913e1jYzsi10wxir?usp=sharing

Note: If everything fails, we have submitted .ipyb files, which can be uploaded to your google colab account and can be ran.
